Today, I've made an effort to learn how to efficiently make use of a Digital Single Lens Reflex(DSLR) Camera. I've learnt that it is an amazing instrument to capture light in unimaginable ways! 

To begin with, we need to know about the *Exposure Triangle* or the 3 pillars - the basics of photography :

* __Shutter Speed__ : all about how much time the sensor is exposed to the scene. To capture without motion blur, set it high and when it is as low as 30", you can't really differentiate between ocean waves and smoke which makes the scene ridiculously beautiful and unimaginable as I mentioned earlier.
* __Aperture__ : refers to the diameter of the holes inside the lens and wide aperture translates to the shallow Depth of Field (DoF) or Blurred background whereas the narrow aperture gives you a deep DoF or a sharp background.
* __ISO__ : As you turn the ISO number up, you increase the brightness. But, at the same time, the image quality decreases. There will be more digital noise or “grain”.

Make the most of this information by experimenting with different combinations on the same scene and comparing the photographs. This exercise really helped me understand the importance of 3 simple settings to click a good and sharp photograph. As per the Pareto Principle, this 20% knowledge can improve your photographs by 80%! Ofcourse the path from there is a steep uphill to go and click a great Photograph.

As Ansel Adams said -

> There is nothing worse than a sharp image of a fuzzy concept!

Well, you've got enough knowledge to click a sharp picture but it is upto your imagination and creativity to realise what is it that you have to click and capture.

 
I have found the following resources online really helpful :
