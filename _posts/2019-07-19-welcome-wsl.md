Documentation is the evidence of our work which we want to remember. And I'm tired of forgetting what I've done and finally, I decided to blog. And yes, Jekyll is the way forward for a mediocre techie with love for GitHub. Previously, I have dealt with many Linux distros like Ubuntu, Fedora, openSUSE, Kali-Linux, Linux Mint but predominantly Ubuntu dual-booted along-side Windows is what I've used for the most of my time.

Don't get me started with the problems during my time with dual-boot(Windows Ubuntu) because as productive as it can be, it could get counter-productive at times.

Also, Nvidia killed off GeForce driver support which was a really bad news for the Linux community. The great Linus Trovalds <a href="https://youtu.be/iYWzMvlj2RQ">ranted</a> vis-à-vis this issue with Nvidia, which didn’t really help. So, how to set up a stable environment where you can enjoy the benefits of both Windows and Linux?</p>

<p>Well, you’ve alternatives don’t you? For starters, we have Virtual Machines. And what to do if you don’t have to use any mainstream applications which run on only Linux?

Recently, Microsoft has announced Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) using which you can run Linux terminal utilities. But the mighty WSL can do more than just what it is meant for. Here's how we can run graphical Linux desktop applications.

* Firstly, you need install [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/wsl/install-win1)
* Now, an X-server is what you need to run [GUI](https://www.howtogeek.com/261575/how-to-run-graphical-linux-desktop-applications-from-windows-10s-bash-shell/)

You are now all set to go as have the CLI and GUI of the new Linux Distro on your Windows machine! This is the environment in which I'm writing my first post. Updates are around the corner!
