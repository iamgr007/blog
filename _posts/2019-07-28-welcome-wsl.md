If you are interested in blogging, Jekyll is the way forward for a mediocre techie with love for GitHub. Previously, I have dealt with many Linux distros like Ubuntu, Fedora, openSUSE, Kali-Linux, Linux Mint but predominantly Ubuntu dual-booted along-side Windows is what I've used for the most of my time and I have faced numerous problems in the beginning as I didn't really understand what was going on exactly. Like I used to mess with the grub uninentionally and had to oft-reinstall the OS.

Also, Nvidia killed off GeForce driver support which was a really bad news for the Linux community. The great Linus Trovalds ranted vis-Ã -vis this issue with Nvidia, which didn't really help. So, how to set up a stable environment where you can enjoy the benefits of both Windows and Linux? 

Well, you've alternatives don't you? For starters, we have Virtual Machines. And what to do if you don't have to use any mainstream applications which run on only Linux?

Recently, Microsoft has announced Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) using which you can run Linux terminal utilities. But the mighty WSL can do more than just what it is meant for. Here's how we can run graphical Linux desktop applications.

* Firstly, you need to install [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/wsl/install-win1)
* Now, an X-server is what you need to run [GUI](https://www.howtogeek.com/261575/how-to-run-graphical-linux-desktop-applications-from-windows-10s-bash-shell/)

You are now all set to go as you have the CLI and GUI of the new Linux Distro on your Windows machine! This is the environment in which I'm writing my first post. Updates are around the corner!
