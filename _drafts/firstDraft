I need to practice typing and using vim at the same time 
ok let's do it
try not to lose the position of your fingers even if you have to peek at times
once you get used to the position, you can try to type without looking down
tip: if you use a wrong finger for the wrong letter, delete the whole word and retype it
practice makes perfect
now that you've got your hands on the keyboard, all you gotta do is speed up. 
confidence is the key
